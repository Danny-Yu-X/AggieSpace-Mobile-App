This is the main project I worked on in ECS 164 (Human-Computer Interaction). In this class, I learned an introduction to concepts and practices of modern human-computer interaction design. In this project, I worked with Cory, Hao, Quanlin, and Jaynor, all of whom are undergraduate students at UC Davis. Across a span of 6 weeks during summer session 2, we designed a product called AggieSpace, an app for UC Davis college roommates to connect. Through a design thinking process, we developed Lo-Fi, Mid-Fi, and Hi-Fi prototypes using collaborative design tools such as Miro and Figma. We then used code.org to develop a simple user interface for our product and followed several UI/UX principles. In the end, we developed a research paper that highlighted our results and it is attached in this repository for reference.
